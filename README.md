# Monte Carlo Project

This project performs a simple Monte Carlo estimate for a function over the interval $[-1, 1]$ and then generates simulated particle-event outputs based on the sampled cosine angles.

## Requirements

- Windows with MSVC toolchain (`cl.exe`)
- Git repository is optional, but the project is designed to run as a standalone C++ executable

## Build

From PowerShell in the project folder:

```powershell
cl /EHsc Final_Monte_Carlo_Code.cpp /Fe:Final_Monte_Carlo_Code.exe
```

## Run

```powershell
.\Final_Monte_Carlo_Code.exe
```

## What it does

- Computes a Monte Carlo estimate of the integral
- Estimates the maximum sampled value and error
- Uses a hit-or-miss method to generate accepted event angles
- Prints event vectors and kinematic quantities for each accepted event

## Notes

- The code uses a fixed center-of-mass energy `ECM = 80`.
- The generated output is intended for inspection and demonstration, not for production physics software.
- You can adjust the number of iterations and generated events in `main()`.
